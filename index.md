Pithos is a native [Pandora Radio](http://pandora.com) client for Linux. It's much more lightweight
than the Pandora.com web client, and integrates with desktop features such as media
keys, notifications, and the sound menu.

## FAQ

### Why the name "Pithos?"

The original Pandora myth used the word "[pithos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pithos),"
which was mistranslated to "box." Similarly, a flash applet is a
mistranslation to the Linux platform.
 
### What does Pithos mean for Pandora?

To support Pandora Media Inc. and enjoy higher quality audio, we recommend
subscribing to [Pandora One](http://pandora.com/one).

### What is the difference between Skip, Love, Ban and Tired?

- Skip: Just skips to the next song. Doesn't influence anything.
- Love: (thumbs up rating) tells Pandora you like that song. Pandora will play this song and similar songs more often on that particular station.
- Ban: (thumbs down rating) tells Pandora you dislike that song and not to play it ever again on that station.
- Tired: tells Pandora to not play that song for a month on this or any other station.

Love, Unrated and Ban can be thought of as +1, 0, and -1. You can Ban a song and then Unrate or Love it to change the rating. Tired is not really a rating. You can't "Un-tired" a song.
