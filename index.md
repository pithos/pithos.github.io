## FAQ

### Why the name "Pithos?"

The original Pandora myth used the word "[pithos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pithos),"
which was mistranslated to "box." Similarly, a flash applet is a
mistranslation to the Linux platform.
 
### What does Pithos mean for Pandora?

To support Pandora Media Inc. and enjoy higher quality audio, we recommend
subscribing to [Pandora One](http://pandora.com/one).
